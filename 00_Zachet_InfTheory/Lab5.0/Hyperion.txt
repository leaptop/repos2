 prologue the hegemony consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played rachmaninoffs prelude in csharp minor on an ancient but wellmaintained steinway while great green saurian things surged and bellowed in the swamps below a thunderstorm was brewing to the north bruiseblack clouds silhouetted a forest of giant gymnosperms while stratocumulus towered nine kilometers high in a violent sky lightning rippled along the horizon closer to the ship occasional vague reptilian shapes would blunder into the interdiction field cry out and then crash away through indigo mists the consul concentrated on a difficult section of the prelude and ignored the approach of storm and nightfall the fatline receiver chimed the consul stopped fingers hovering above the keyboard and listened thunder rumbled through the heavy air from the direction of the gymnosperm forest there came the mournful ululation of a carrionbreed pack somewhere in the darkness below a smallbrained beast trumpeted its answering challenge and fell quiet the interdiction field added its sonic undertones to the sudden silence the fatline chimed again damn  said the consul and went in to answer it while the computer took a few seconds to convert and decode the burst of decaying tachyons the consul poured himself a glass of scotch he settled into the cushions of the projection pit just as the diskey blinked green play  he said you have been chosen to return to hyperion  came a womans husky voice full visuals had not yet formed the air remained empty except for the pulse of transmission codes which told the consul that this fatline squirt had originated on the hegemony administrative world of tau ceti center the consul did not need the transmission coordinates to know this the aged but still beautiful voice of meina gladstone was unmistakable you have been chosen to return to hyperion as a member of the shrike pilgrimage  continued the voice the hell you say thought the consul and rose to leave the pit you and six others have been selected by the church of the shrike and confirmed by the all thing  said meina gladstone it is in the interest of the hegemony that you accept  the consul stood motionless in the pit his back to the flickering transmission codes without turning he raised his glass and drained the last of the scotch the situation is very confused  said meina gladstone her voice was weary the consulate and home rule council fatlined us three standard weeks ago with the news that the time tombs showed signs of opening the antientropic fields around them were expanding rapidly and the shrike has begun ranging as far south as the bridle range  the consul turned and dropped into the cushions a holo had formed of meina gladstones ancient face her eyes looked as tired as her voice sounded a forcespace task force was immediately dispatched from parvati to evacuate the hegemony citizens on hyperion before the time tombs open their timedebt will be a little more than three hyperion years  meina gladstone paused the consul thought he had never seen the senate ceo look so grim we do not know if the evacuation fleet will arrive in time  she said but the situation is even more complicated an ouster migration cluster of at least four thousand  units  has been detected approaching the hyperion system our evacuation task force should arrive only a short while before the ousters  the consul understood gladstones hesitation an ouster migration cluster might consist of ships ranging in size from singleperson ramscouts to can cities and comet forts holding tens of thousands of the interstellar barbarians the force joint chiefs believe that this is the ousters big push  said meina gladstone the ships computer had positioned the holo so that the womans sad brown eyes seemed to be staring directly at the consul whether they seek to control just hyperion for the time tombs or whether this is an allout attack on the worldweb remains to be seen in the meantime a full forcespace battle fleet complete with a farcaster construction battalion has spun up from the camn system to join the evacuation task force but this fleet may be recalled depending upon circumstances  the consul nodded and absently raised the scotch to his lips he frowned at the empty glass and dropped it onto the thick carpeting of the holopit even with no military training he understood the difficult tactical decision gladstone and the joint chiefs were faced with unless a military farcaster were hurriedly constructed in the hyperion system at staggering expense there would be no way to resist the ouster invasion whatever secrets the time tombs might hold would go to the hegemonys enemy if the fleet did construct a farcaster in time and the hegemony committed the total resources of force to defending the single distant colonial world of hyperion the worldweb ran the terrible risk of suffering an ouster attack elsewhere on the perimeter or in a worstcase scenario having the barbarians actually seizing the farcaster and penetrating the web itself the consul tried to imagine the reality of armored ouster troops stepping through farcaster portals into the undefended home cities on a hundred worlds the consul walked through the holo of meina gladstone retrieved his glass and went to pour another scotch you have been chosen to join the pilgrimage to the shrike  said the image of the old ceo whom the press loved to compare to lincoln or churchill or alvareztemp or whatever other prehegira legend was in historical vogue at the time the templars are sending their treeship yggdrasill  said gladstone and the evacuation task force commander has instructions to let it pass with a threeweek timedebt you can rendezvous with the yggdrasill before it goes quantum from the parvati system the six other pilgrims chosen by the shrike church will be aboard the treeship our intelligence reports suggest that at least one of the seven pilgrims is an agent of the ousters we do not  at this time  have any way of knowing which one it is  the consul had to smile among all the other risks gladstone was taking the old woman had to consider the possibility that he was the spy and that she was fatlining crucial information to an ouster agent or had she given him any crucial information  the fleet movements were detectable as soon as the ships used their hawking drives and if the consul were the spy the ceos revelation might be a way to scare him off the consuls smile faded and he drank his scotch sol weintraub and fedmahn kassad are among the seven pilgrims chosen  said gladstone the consuls frown deepened he stared at the cloud of digits flickering like dust motes around the old womans image fifteen seconds of fatline transmission time remained we need your help  said meina gladstone it is essential that the secrets of the time tombs and the shrike be uncovered this pilgrimage may be our last chance if the ousters conquer hyperion their agent must be eliminated and the time tombs sealed at all cost the fate of the hegemony may depend upon it  the transmission ended except for the pulse of rendezvous coordinates response   asked the ships computer despite the tremendous energies involved the spacecraft was capable of placing a brief coded squirt into the incessant babble of ftl bursts which tied the human portions of the galaxy together no  said the consul and went outside to lean on the balcony railing night had fallen and the clouds were low no stars were visible the darkness would have been absolute except for the intermittent flash of lightning to the north and a soft phosphorescence rising from the marshes the consul was suddenly very aware that he was at that second the only sentient being on an unnamed world he listened to the antediluvian night sounds rising from the swamps and he thought about morning about setting out in the vikken emv at first light about spending the day in sunshine about hunting big game in the fern forests to the south and then returning to the ship in the evening for a good steak and a cold beer the consul thought about the sharp pleasure of the hunt and the equally sharp solace of solitude solitude he had earned through the pain and nightmare he had already suffered on hyperion hyperion the consul went inside brought the balcony in and sealed the ship just as the first heavy raindrops began to fall he climbed the spiral staircase to his sleeping cabin at the apex of the ship the circular room was dark except for silent explosions of lightning which outlined rivulets of rain coursing the skylight the consul stripped lay back on the firm mattress and switched on the sound system and external audio pickups he listened as the fury of the storm blended with the violence of wagners flight of the valkyries  hurricane winds buffeted the ship the sound of thunderclaps filled the room as the skylight flashed white leaving afterimages burning in the consuls retinas wagner is good only for thunderstorms he thought he closed his eyes but the lightning was visible through closed eyelids he remembered the glint of ice crystals blowing through the tumbled ruins on the low hills near the time tombs and the colder gleam of steel on the shrikes impossible tree of metal thorns he remembered screams in the night and the hundredfacet rubyandblood gaze of the shrike itself hyperion the consul silently commanded the computer to shut off all speakers and raised his wrist to cover his eyes in the sudden silence he lay thinking about how insane it would be to return to hyperion during his eleven years as consul on that distant and enigmatic world the mysterious church of the shrike had allowed a dozen barges of off world pilgrims to depart for the windswept barrens around the time tombs north of the mountains no one had returned and that had been in normal times when the shrike had been prisoner to the tides of time and forces no one understood and the antientropic fields had been contained to a few dozen meters around the time tombs and there had been no threat of an ouster invasion the consul thought of the shrike free to wander everywhere on hyperion of the millions of indigenies and thousands of hegemony citizens helpless before a creature which defied physical laws and which communicated only through death and he shivered despite the warmth of the cabin hyperion the night and storm passed another stormfront raced ahead of the approaching dawn gymnosperms two hundred meters tall bent and whipped before the coming torrent just before first light the consuls ebony spaceship rose on a tail of blue plasma and punched through thickening clouds as it climbed toward space and rendezvous  the consul awoke with the peculiar headache dry throat and sense of having forgotten a thousand dreams which only periods in cryogenic fugue could bring he blinked sat upright on a low couch and groggily pushed away the last sensor tapes clinging to his skin there were two very short crew clones and one very tall hooded templar with him in the windowless ovoid of a room one of the clones offered the consul the traditional postthaw glass of orange juice he accepted it and drank greedily the tree is two lightminutes and five hours of travel from hyperion  said the templar and the consul realized that he was being addressed by het masteen captain of the templar treeship and true voice of the tree the consul vaguely realized that it was a great honor to be awakened by the captain but he was too groggy and disoriented from fugue to appreciate it the others have been awake for some hours  said het masteen and gestured for the clones to leave them they have assembled on the foremost dining platform  hhrghn  said the consul and took a drink he cleared his throat and tried again thank you het masteen  he managed looking around at the eggshaped room with its carpet of dark grass translucent walls and support ribs of continuous curved weirwood the consul realized that he must be in one of the smaller environment pods closing his eyes he tried to recall his memories of rendezvous just before the templar ship went quantum the consul remembered his first glimpse of the kilometerlong treeship as he closed for rendezvous the treeships details blurred by the redundant machine and erggenerated containment fields which surrounded it like a spherical mist but its leafy bulk clearly ablaze with thousands of lights which shone softly through leaves and thinwalled environment pods or along countless platforms bridges command decks stairways and bowers around the base of the treeship engineering and cargo spheres clustered like oversized galls while blue and violet drive streamers trailed behind like tenkilometerlong roots  the others await  het masteen said softly and nodded toward low cushions where the consuls luggage lay ready to open upon his command the templar gazed thoughtfully at the weirwood rafters while the consul dressed in semiformal evening wear of loose black trousers polished ship boots a white silk blouse which ballooned at waist and elbows topaz collar cinch black demicoat complete with slashes of hegemony crimson on the epaulets and a soft gold tricorne a section of curved wall became a mirror and the consul stared at the image there a more than middleaged man in semiformal evening wear sunburned skin but oddly pale under the sad eyes the consul frowned nodded and turned away het masteen gestured and the consul followed the tall robed figure through a dilation in the pod onto an ascending walkway which curved up and out of sight around the massive bark wall of the treeships trunk the consul paused moved to the edge of the walkway and took a quick step back it was at least six hundred meters down down being created by the onesixth standard gravity being generated by the singularities imprisoned at the base of the tree and there were no railings they resumed their silent ascent turning off from the main trunk walkway thirty meters and half a trunkspiral later to cross a flimsy suspension bridge to a fivemeterwide branch they followed this outward to where the riot of leaves caught the glare of hyperions sun has my ship been brought out of storage   asked the consul it is fueled and ready in sphere   said het masteen they passed into the shadow of the trunk and stars became visible in the black patches between the dark latticework of leaves the other pilgrims have agreed to ferry down in your ship if the force authorities give permission  added the templar the consul rubbed his eyes and wished that he had been allowed more time to retrieve his wits from the cold grip of cryonic fugue youve been in touch with the task force   oh yes we were challenged the moment we tunneled down from quantum leap a hegemony warship is  escorting us  this very moment  het masteen gestured toward a patch of sky above them the consul squinted upward but at that second segments of the upper tiers of branches revolved out of the treeships shadow and acres of leaves ignited in sunset hues even in the still shadowed places glowbirds nestled like japanese lanterns above lighted walkways glowing swingvines and illuminated hanging bridges while fireflies from old earth and radiant gossamers from mauicovenant blinked and coded their way through labyrinths of leaves mixing with constellations sufficiently to fool even the most starwise traveler het masteen stepped into a basket lift hanging from a whiskeredcarbon cable which disappeared into the three hundred meters of tree above them the consul followed and they were borne silently upward he noted that the walkways pods and platforms were conspicuously empty except for a few templars and their diminutive crew clone counterparts the consul could recall seeing no other passengers during his rushed hour between rendezvous and fugue but he had put that down to the imminence of the treeship going quantum assuming then that the passengers were safe in their fugue couches now however the treeship was traveling for below relativistic velocities and its branches should be crowded with gawking passengers he mentioned his observation to the templar the six of you are our only passengers  said het masteen the basket stopped in a maze of foliage and the treeship captain led the way up a wooden escalator worn with age the consul blinked in surprise a templar treeship normally carried between two and five thousand passengers it was easily the most desirable way to travel between the stars treeships rarely accrued more than a four or fivemonth timedebt making short scenic crossings where star systems were a very few lightyears apart thus allowing their affluent passengers to spend as little time as necessary in fugue for the treeship to make the trip to hyperion and back accumulating six years of web time with no paying passengers would mean a staggering financial loss to the templars then the consul realized belatedly that the treeship would be ideal for the upcoming evacuation its expenses ultimately to be reimbursed by the hegemony still the consul knew to bring a ship as beautiful and vulnerable as the yggdrasill one of only five of its kind into a war zone was a terrible risk for the templar brotherhood your fellow pilgrims  announced het masteen as he and the consul emerged onto a broad platform where a small group waited at one end of a long wooden table above them the stars burned rotating occasionally as the treeship changed its pitch or yaw while to either side a solid sphere of foliage curved away like the green skin of some great fruit the consul immediately recognized the setting as the captains dining platform even before the five other passengers rose to let het masteen take his place at the head of the table the consul found an empty chair waiting for him to the left of the captain when everyone was seated and quiet het masteen made formal introductions although the consul knew none of the others from personal experience several of the names were familiar and he used his diplomats long training to file away identities and impressions to the consuls left sat father lenar hoyt a priest of the oldstyle christian sect known as catholic for a second the consul had forgotten the significance of the black clothing and roman collar but then he remembered st francis hospital on hebron where he had received alcohol trauma therapy after his disastrous first diplomatic assignment there almost four standard decades earlier and at the mention of hoyts name he remembered another priest one who had disappeared on hyperion halfway through his own tenure there lenar hoyt was a young man by the consuls reckoning no more than his early thirties but it appeared that something had aged the man terribly in the not too distant past the consul looked at the thin face cheekbones pressing against sallow flesh eyes large but hooded in deep hollows thin lips set in a permanent twitch of muscle too downturned to be called even a cynical smile the hairline not so much receding as ravaged by radiation and he felt he was looking at a man who had been ill for years still the consul was surprised that behind that mask of concealed pain there remained the physical echo of the boy in the man the faintest remnants of the round face fair skin and soft mouth which had belonged to a younger healthier less cynical lenar hoyt next to the priest sat a man whose image had been familiar to most citizens of the hegemony some years before the consul wondered if the collective attention span in the worldweb was as short now as it had been when he had lived there shorter probably if so then colonel fedmahn kassad the socalled butcher of south bressia was probably no longer either infamous or famous to the consuls generation and to all those who lived in the slow expatriate fringe of things kassad was not someone one was likely to forget colonel fedmahn kassad was tall almost tall enough to look the twometer het masteen in the eye and dressed in force black with no rank insignia or citations showing the black uniform was oddly similar to father hoyts garb but there was no real resemblance between the two men in lieu of hoyts wasted appearance kassad was brown obviously fit and whiphandle lean with strands of muscle showing in shoulder wrist and throat the colonels eyes were small dark and as allencompassing as the lenses of some primitive video camera his face was all angles shadows planes and facets not gaunt like father hoyts merely carved from cold stone a thin line of beard along his jawline served to accent the sharpness of his countenance as surely as blood on a knife blade the colonels intense slow movements reminded the consul of an earthbred jaguar he had seen in a private seedship zoo on lusus many years before kassads voice was soft but the consul did not fail to notice that even the colonels silences commanded attention most of the long table was empty the group clustered at one end across from fedmahn kassad sat a man introduced as the poet martin silenus silenus appeared to be quite the opposite of the military man across from him where kassad was lean and tall martin silenus was short and visibly out of shape countering kassads stonecut features the poets face was as mobile and expressive as an earth primates his voice was a loud profane rasp there was something thought the consul almost pleasantly demonic about martin silenus with his ruddy cheeks broad mouth pitched eyebrows sharp ears and constantly moving hands sporting fingers long enough to serve a concert pianist or a strangler the poets silver hair had been cropped into roughhewn bangs martin silenus seemed to be in his late fifties but the consul noticed the telltale blue tinge to throat and palms and suspected that the man had been through more than a few poulsen treatments silenuss true age might be anywhere from ninety to a hundred and fifty standard years if he were close to the latter age the consul knew the odds were that the poet was quite mad as boisterous and animated as martin silenus seemed upon first encounter so the next guest at the table exuded an immediate and equally impressive sense of intelligent reticence sol weintraub looked up upon introduction and the consul noted the short gray beard lined forehead and sad luminous eyes of the wellknown scholar the consul had heard tales of the wandering jew and his hopeless quest but he was shocked to realize that the old man now held the infant in his arms his daughter rachel no more than a few weeks old the consul looked away the sixth pilgrim and only woman at the table was brawne lamia when introduced the detective stared at the consul with such intensity that he could feel the pressure of her gaze even after she looked away a former citizen of the g world of lusus brawne lamia was no taller than the poet two chairs to her right but even her loose corduroy shipsuit did not conceal the heavy layers of muscle on her compact form black curls reached to her shoulders her eyebrows were two dark lines dabbed horizontally across a wide brow and her nose was solid and sharp intensifying the aquiline quality of her stare lamias mouth was wide and expressive to the point of being sensuous curled slightly at the corners in a slight smile which might be cruel or merely playful the womans dark eyes seemed to dare the observer to discover which was the case it occurred to the consul that brawne lamia might well be considered beautiful introductions completed the consul cleared his throat and turned toward the templar het masteen you said that there were seven pilgrims is m weintraubs child the seventh   het masteens hood moved slowly from side to side no only those who make a conscious decision to seek the shrike may be counted among the pilgrims  the group at the table stirred slightly each must know what the consul knew only a group comprising a prime number of pilgrims might make the shrike churchsponsored trip north i am the seventh  said het masteen captain of the templar treeship yggdrasill and true voice of the tree in the silence which followed the announcement het masteen gestured and a group of crew clones began serving the pilgrims their last meal before planetfall so the ousters are not insystem yet   asked brawne lamia her voice had a husky throaty quality which strangely stirred the consul no  said het masteen but we cannot be more than a few standard days ahead of them our instruments have detected fusion skirmishes within the systems ort cloud  will there be war   asked father hoyt his voice seemed as fatigued as his expression when no one volunteered a response the priest turned to his right as if retroactively directing the question to the consul the consul sighed the crew clones had served wine he wished it had been whiskey who knows what the ousters will do   he said they no longer appear to be motivated by human logic  martin silenus laughed loudly spilling his wine as he gestured as if we fucking humans were ever motivated by human logic  he took a deep drink wiped his mouth and laughed again brawne lamia frowned if the serious fighting starts too soon  she said perhaps the authorities will not allow us to land  we will be allowed to pass  said het masteen sunlight found its way past folds in his cowl to fall on yellowish skin saved from certain death in war to be delivered to certain death at the hands of the shrike  murmured father hoyt there is no death in all the universe  intoned martin silenus in a voice which the consul felt sure could have awakened someone deep in cryogenic fugue the poet drained the last of his wine and raised the empty goblet in an apparent toast to the stars no smell of death there shall be no death moan moan moan cybele moan for thy pernicious babes have changed a god into a shaking palsy moan brethren moan for i have no strength left weak as the reed weak feeble as my voice  oh oh the pain the pain of feebleness moan moan for still i thaw  silenus abruptly broke off and poured more wine belching once into the silence which had followed his recitation the other six looked at one another the consul noticed that sol weintraub was smiling slightly until the baby in his arms stirred and distracted him well  said father hoyt hesitantly as if trying to retrieve an earlier strand of thought if the hegemony convoy leaves and the ousters take hyperion perhaps the occupation will be bloodless and theyll let us go about our business  colonel fedmahn kassad laughed softly the ousters dont want to occupy hyperion  he said if they take the planet theyll loot what they want and then do what they do best theyll burn the cities into charred rubble break the rubble into smaller pieces and then bake the pieces until they glow theyll melt the poles boil the oceans and then use the residue to salt whats left of the continents so nothing will ever grow there again  well   began father hoyt and then trailed off there was no conversation as the clones cleared the soup and salad dishes and brought on the main course you said that there was a hegemony warship escorting us  the consul said to het masteen as they finished their roast beef and boiled sky squid the templar nodded and pointed the consul squinted but could make out nothing moving against the rotating starfield here  said fedmahn kassad and leaned across father hoyt to hand the consul a collapsible pair of military binoculars the consul nodded his thanks thumbed on the power and scanned the patch of sky het masteen had indicated gyroscopic crystals in the binoculars hummed slightly as they stabilized the optics and swept the area in a programmed search pattern suddenly the image froze blurred expanded and steadied the consul could not avoid an involuntary intake of breath as the hegemony ship filled the viewer neither the expected fieldblurred seed of a solo ramscout nor the bulb of a torchship the electronically outlined image was of a matteblack attack carrier the thing was impressive in the way only warships through the centuries had succeeded in being the hegemony spinship was incongruously streamlined with its four sets of boom arms retracted in battle readiness its sixtymeter command probe sharp as a clovis point and its hawking drive and fusion blisters set far back along the launch shaft like feathers on an arrow the consul handed the binoculars back to kassad without comment if the task force was using a full attack carrier to escort the yggdrasill what kind of firepower were they setting in place to meet the ouster invasion
