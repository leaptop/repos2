    "Description": "IImplicitUndirectedGraph defines a bool ContainsEdge(TVertex source, TVertex target) method but no bool TryGetEdge(TVertex source, TVertex target, out TEdge edge) method. These two methods belong together as part of the standard Contains/TryGet pattern, and in fact the interface for directed graphs (IIncidenceGraph) that defines the ContainsEdge(source,target) method does also define a TryGetEdge(source,target,out edge) method. I think this was just overlooked.",
