    "Description": "Hi,\nI have an unhandled null pointer exception in Line 351 of FibonacciHeap.cs:  if (deletingNode || (priorityComparsion(NewKey, next.Priority) * DirectionMultiplier) < 0).\nIn file bug.7z (compressed with GNU 7Zip, http://www.7-zip.org/, please let me know if it's a problem, I'll install something else ) there is both the self contained project as well as a jpeg snip of the visual studio 2010 debugger window stopped with the exception, together with the locals and the stack. There is no problem when Prim is changed to Kruskal.\n \nThe project referencing QuickGraph is written in F#, the graph here was built trivially by just adding vertices and edges, not using the delegates. Please let me know if some clarifications/tests are needed.\n \nThanks,\nVladimir",
