    "Description": "It is a DAG. I build a database schema representation as a graph. Vertexes are tables, edges are foreign key constraints.\n \nI'm really illiterate on graph theory, hence why I'm asking if there is a way to find the critical path using the existing framework or if I have to modify one of the algorithms (DijkstraShortestPathAlgorithm perhaps) to do this. A DAG exactly represents my problem hence why I chose it.\n \nAs for the exact path, won't the DFS algorithm give me the shortest path to a node? Assuming, that I have multiple paths to a node, I need the critical path, not the shortest path.\n \nThank you.\n \n-Nick",

As it applies to databases in my problem, it is the path that will result in the larges amount of foreign key joins.\r\n\r\nIn a general context I'm assuming it is the path that has the largest weight. I'm assuming this only makes sense in a DAG.",
