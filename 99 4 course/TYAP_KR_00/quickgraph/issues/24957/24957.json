    "Description": "Hi,\n\nThis could also be reproduced even in the sample program. If there has been one graph loaded, and then load another one and hover the mouse cursor to any of the nodes to be replaced during the replacement animation, exception KeyNotFoundException will be thrown.\n\nHere is the call stack:\n   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)\n   at QuickGraph.BidirectionalGraph`2.ContainsEdge(TEdge edge)\n   at GraphSharp.Controls.GraphLayout`3.HighlightTriggerEventHandler(Object sender, HighlightTriggeredEventArgs args)\n\nIt seems that the event handler try to highlight the edge when the edge is being deleted.\n\nSuggest to add a try-catch handler to avoid the unnecessary exception.\n\nMars",
