    "Description": "Hi again,\n \nFirstly, thanks for the quicker reponse, I really appreciate your effort.\n \nOnce wrote this post, I began to research deeper and I found that the graphviz writer has always, or in major cases, the same behaviour. \n \nIt includes the header digraph on dot files without take into account the graph type. I don't know if this is an error or not because I'm a begginer with this API.\n \nI solved it with a \"little trick\". Keep the data structure of UndirectedGraph for compatibility purposes, and change edge direction toNone on rendering tier, and get a true correspondence between data structure and rendering tier.\n \nRegards.",
