    "Html": "<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>\r\n<p>After a long time I finally got some time to verify this algo as I use in my railroad software 'LocCommander' . And I'm impressed with this algo I'm now able to determine all the paths between 2 points in my layout.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>\r\n<p>However, as a 'modelrailroad' layout can become a very large graph, I wonder if some improvements could be done so that the algo speeds up in finding all 'true'&nbsp;paths.</p>\r\n<p>users.telenet.be/loccommander/images/layout.png</p>\r\n<p>In the screenshot (please see the hyperlink below) &nbsp;you can see that when having a &quot;triple switch&quot; a lot of paths are possible although only a few paths(green)&nbsp;are really possible for a train to travel along.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the algo has calculated all possible paths it is easy for me to filter out the good ones, but I wonder if in some way the algo could be modified so that it stops with determinating a path if certain conditions are forfilled that determine that a path is not usable.</p>\r\n<p>users.telenet.be/loccommander/images/triple.png</p>\r\n<p>Thus two successive edges having the same tag (the same&nbsp;triple switch)&nbsp;should not be investigated further... Could this be possible? Or should I use something different. In my current layout it can take up to 10 minutes (half Giga memory)&nbsp;to calculate all paths between two points in the layout... The max value is set to 10000.&nbsp; For a small layout with a few switches it goes pretty well!</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Frank Vieren</p>",
