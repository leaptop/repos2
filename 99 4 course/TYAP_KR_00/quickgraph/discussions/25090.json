I have tested it in VS2008 Windows Form Project with GLEE and it works but it seems that GLEE does not work smoothly with WPF.<br /><br />I think that neither GLEE nor GraphViz are good solutions if you want to have a minimum interaction with the graph.<br /><br />For that I was wondering if anybody was developing something with WPF? <br />",
