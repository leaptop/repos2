From what i can tell the algorotihm should fire A event each step along the path, (the treeevent?), so by looking at those i can build up an idea of the path travelled.</p>\n<p>I have the following code (excldued the graph creation for brevity), i've tried everything i can think of to get this up and running, but its got me stumped, so question is what should how should be calling this?, i realise that i'm proably being silly,  but i feel like screaming here :-) - Only examples i can find has EdgeEventArgs but i cant find those in the package</p>\n<p>&nbsp;RandomWalkAlgorithm&lt;int, Edge&lt;int&gt;&gt; rw = new RandomWalkAlgorithm&lt;int, Edge&lt;int&gt;&gt;(Graph);<br /> &nbsp;rw.Generate(1);</p>\n<p>rw.TreeEdge += new EdgeAction&lt;int&gt;(this.TreeEdge);</p>\n<p>And have this method:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>public void TreeEdge(EdgeAction&lt;int,Edge&lt;int&gt;&gt; e)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(e.Target);<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>",
