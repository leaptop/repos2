Is there any plan to support the idea of ports in QuickGraph?</p>\r\n<p>Example: Circuit design</p>\r\n<p>Node = Microchip, Port = Pin on the chip, Edge = Connection between pin A of chip B to pin C of chip D</p>\r\n<p>What would be the best way to integrate this functionality in QuickGraph???</p>\r\n<p>Regards Matthias</p>\r\n",
