Congrats!</p>\r\n<p>I have one question, because the documentation is somewhat lacking (missing): If I use the QuickGraph Silverlight dll in a SL project, is there any (easy) way to&nbsp;see the graph in the SL page&nbsp;and interact with it visually? On your old CodeProject article you mentioned that for winforms you could dispaly the graphs using the tool &quot;Graphviz&quot;. However, it has no Silverlight implementation, or even an&nbsp;alternative, as far as I see.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
