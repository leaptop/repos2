If I understand the flow correct, I would be required to manipulate the DataSetGraph object and make it output a 'dot' file that can then be fed to GraphViz module in QuickGraph (which will then take over and output an image file??).</p>\r\n<p>I will try this option and post my feedback here.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again.</p>",
