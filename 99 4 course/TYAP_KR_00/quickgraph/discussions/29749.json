I use the state of the robot as a Vertex and the control I give to the robot as a tag in an Edge.<br>\r\nI need help in using BFS since I am new in using this library. I need a way to give a starting state and a finish state and use BFS to find the quickest (least states between start and finish) route.<br>\r\nIs there a way to have BFS give me a list of edges so I can extract the commands from them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance,<br>\r\n",
