    "Html": "<p>I haven't looked into Graphviz. I only tried .dot file generation. That works well but alone won't give you anything in terms of interaction of course. I used this only to then generate .svg images through the http://rise4fun.com/services.svc/ask/agl service, just as it was included in QuickGraph previously but then removed. Basically this service takes a .dot string (the representation of a graph) and returns the SVG XML.</p>\r\n<p>But if you want interactive layouts for web pages, I don't advice that for you. JIT is much better in terms of interactivity, as well as <a href=\"http://www.graphdracula.net/\">Dracula</a> or <a href=\"http://jsplumb.org\">jsPlumb</a>. <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/canviz/\">Canviz</a> as an in-browser .dot viewer is promising but not yet ready.</p>",
