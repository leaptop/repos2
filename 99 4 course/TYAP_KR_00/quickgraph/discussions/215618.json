The data being stored at the node is hierarchical in nature (displayed in a tree view using Graph#). I'm having no issues with serializing/deserializing the structure of the graph and I am able to serialize some of the data (title of the node and node id) to graphml but I am having a lot of trouble reconstituting the node with that data (I'm able to get the id but it's kinda hacky). Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Andrew</p>",
