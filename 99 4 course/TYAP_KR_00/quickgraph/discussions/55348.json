Q1 is connected by an edge to Q3, Q2, Q6; Q3 is connected by an edge to Q5 and Q4; Q4 and Q5 are connected by an edge to Q8; Q2 is connected by an edge to Q8;Q6 is connected by an edge to Q7 and next with Q8. <br>\r\nFigure: <a href=\"http://img4.imageshack.us/my.php?image=exampleschema.jpg\"><img alt=\"Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us\" src=\"http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/2015/exampleschema.th.jpg\" style=\"border-style:solid;border-width:0px\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is just demonstration structure. I need to build the graph that has one starting block and one ending block (e.g. like tree-structure) where vertices can have several in-edges and out-edges each. <br>\r\nI would like to know which algorithm is the best for that purpose and which is the most suitable for drawing vertices.&nbsp; The entire work is to be done in Silverlight 2.0 therefore a ready-made solution is out of the question.&nbsp; I would like to use some solution from QuickGraph library for Silverlight and implement some algorithms for drawing blocks by myself.<br>\r\nThanks in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
