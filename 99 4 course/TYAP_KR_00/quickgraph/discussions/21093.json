The code there calls a \"MarkedEdge\" class that doesn't seem to be defined in the source code you have provided. I do see it in the compiled assembly, however.<br /><br />   Is the source code you have provided the most recent version, or the compiled version? Why are they different? What else in the binary form is missing from the source code?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />CVK<br />",

I noticed also that GleeUtility referenced in the manual is now called GleeGraphUtility, and the .Execute() method of GleeGraphPopulator has been changed to Compute().<br /><br />Having gotten it working, though, it looks like a pretty cool library/utility set. I'm looking forward to getting into more detail with it.<br />",
