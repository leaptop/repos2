When I declare an edge I want to connect from one specific cell on the first node to one specific cell on the second. Using graphviz straight-up this down via 'ports'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see where I can specify the port names for each cell but I do not see where I can specify the ports of the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan someone point in the direction where I can find this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you,<br>\r\nJoe<br>\r\n",
