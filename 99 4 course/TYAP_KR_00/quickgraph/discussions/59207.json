There's something that I've been wondering if it could me help with. Im developing an app that needs a interactive representation of a Graph; stuff like clicking in a node to remove it, context menus to create transition and so. Im developing this application in C# using Windows Forms. Since all I get are text files or PNG files which are not really interactive, could someone please tell me how could I integrate an interactive representation of a Graph into my forms?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
