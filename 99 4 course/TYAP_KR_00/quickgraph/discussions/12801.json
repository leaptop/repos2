I have graphs from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 vertices that I'd like to draw.<br /><br />I will try it out shortly, and see how it goes, but was wondering if anyone had suggestions.  Perhaps if the graphs are too big (take too long to draw or move) then maybe I could draw parts of it first, and add more in as the user pans?<br /><br />- Alex<br />",

They kind of layout they are doing is just not meant for millions of graphs.<br /><br />If you are looking for rendering large graphs (million of nodes), you will need to implement you own special algorithm. There's already quite a bit of litterature of the subject so I'll advice to look around, read articles before going on. <br /><br />Look for 'spring layout' from Fruchterman and Reingold, this a good place to start looking for interreting papers.<br />",
