However, it seems that the algorithm currently takes all vertices in a graph into account, whereas I only want to select amongst a subset.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, if I have a graph of 1000 vertices - I might want to know the distances between 10 of these, rather than between every single vertex. Is this possible at the moment? \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",
