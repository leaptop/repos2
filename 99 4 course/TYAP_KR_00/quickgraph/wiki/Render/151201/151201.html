<div class="wikidoc"><h4>Algorithms Concepts</h4>
QuickGraph contains a set of algorithms that solve classic graph theory problems. Algorithms are designed around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">command pattern</a>, i.e. their execution is encapsulated into classes. Most algorithms are categorized by the kind of problem they can solve (note that some algorithms just donâ€™t fit in those categories):
<ul><li>Vertex predecessors,</li>
<li>Edge predecessors,</li>
<li>Vertex distances,</li>
<li>Time stampers</li></ul>
 <br /><i>tip:</i> The <span class="codeInline">QuickGraph.Algorithms</span> namespace contains a static class, <a href="https://quickgraph.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=AlgorithmExtensions&referringTitle=Algorithm%20Concepts">AlgorithmExtensions</a>, that contains a set of extension methods that encapsulate the creation and processing of algorithms instances.<br /><br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
