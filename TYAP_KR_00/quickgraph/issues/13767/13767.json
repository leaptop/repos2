    "Description": "I believe F#'s event support requires events be of type EventHandler<T> with the event args derived from EventArgs.\n \ncompiler error:\nVertexService.fs(183,9): error FS0191: The event 'EdgeAdded has a non-standard type. If this event is declared in another .NET language, you may need to access this event using the explicit add_EdgeAdded and remove_EdgeAdded methods for the event. If this event is declared in F#, make the type of the event an instantiation of either 'IDelegateEvent<_>' or 'IEvent<_,_>'\n \nhere is a repro case from vs2008 with the current f# ctp, though it should also fail in vs2010:\n \nlet x = QuickGraph.BidirectionalGraph()\nx.EdgeAdded |> Event.listen (fun _ -> ()) // error\nx.add_EdgeAdded(fun _ -> ()) // works",

I agree it's pretty dumb but I'm not sure if they're going to fix it for VS 2010... mostly due to generic constraints put on the F# Event library. I've attached a simple repro case that shows it being fixed by using EventHandler<T> & EventArgs.",
