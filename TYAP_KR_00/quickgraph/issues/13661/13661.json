    "Description": "I believe that the intent is for the Debug/Release build to succeed even with no valid reference to Microsoft.Contracts.dll. However, the QuickGraph.Silverlight project fails to build because the compiler can't find the Contract class. I think the INLINED_CONTRACTS conditional compilation symbol needs to be added to those build configurations.",
