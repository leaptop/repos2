    "Description": "That's doable.\n-- \nHave you considered to create an interface for VertexEdgeDictionary, e.g. IVertexEdgeDictionary and allow the user to pass in their own created objects for that in the constructors of graphs, such as passing in two such objects to BidirectionalGraph?\nÂ \nI want to create my own provider for the graphs and not use the one that inherits the Dictionary.",
