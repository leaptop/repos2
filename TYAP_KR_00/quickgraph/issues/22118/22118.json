    "Description": "In QuickGraph.Algorithms.RootedAlgorithmBase<TVertex,TGraph>.SetRootVertex(TVertex rootVertex) you do the following to check, if the same root vertex is already set:\n \n    Comparer<TVertex>.Default.Compare(this.rootVertex, rootVertex) != 0;\n \nThis is a problem, if you use a TVertex, which is not IComparable. It would be better to use EqualityComparer<TVertex>.Default, which uses the IEquatable<TVertex> interface or the standard .Equals()-method, which is present for every object.\n \nAs a consequence, at the moment no algorithm derived from RootedAlgorithmBase is able to process graphs using a TVertex, which is not IComparable.",

After upgrading my nuget dependency to the 3.6 release my code stopped working:\r\n\r\nI got an exception in ShortestPathsDijkstra for IUndirectedGraph saying something about IComparable. I guessed that I had to implement IComparable for my TVertex and indeed that did solve the problem.",
