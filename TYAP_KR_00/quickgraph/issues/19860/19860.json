I do not know if this is expected, but I'm bringing it to your attention as an impeding issue.\n \nAlso, in the test results, TarjanOfflineLeastCommonAncestorAlgorithm timed out. I will try to run it on a faster computer to find out if this is a real issue or just the result of slow execution on this machine.\n \n        public KeyValuePair<TPriority, TValue> RemoveAt(int index)\n        {\n            if (this.count == 0)\n                throw new InvalidOperationException(\"heap is empty\");\n            if (index < 0 | index >= this.count | index + this.count < this.count)\n~~~~~~~~>        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(\"index\");",
