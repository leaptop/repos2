    "Description": "I intend to use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to perform negative cycle detection. It appears to me that there is something wrong in the implementation of the algorithm (source revision quickgraph-60730).  In BellmanFordShortestPathAlgorithm.cs, line 229:230\n \n                if (edgeWeight < 0)\n                    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"non negative edge weight\");\n \nIt is not clear to me why the algorithm should fail on non-negative edge weights, since the main use of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is for shortest path in the presence of negative weights. \n \nThere is also something strange with the description:\n \n        /// <returns>true if successful, false if there was a negative cycle.</returns>\n        protected override void InternalCompute()\n \nThe documentation suggests a boolean return, but the implementation is for void.",
