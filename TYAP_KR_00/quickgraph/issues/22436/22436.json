    "Description": "I installed QuickGraph via Nuget, on Visual Studio Professional 2010.  I can now access the assemblies QuickGraph, QuickGraph.Algorithms, QuickGraph.Collections,  QuickGraph.Contracts,  QuickGraph.Data,  QuickGraph.Graphviz,  QuickGraph.Predicates, and  QuickGraph.Serialization.  However, when I try to import the glee extensions via \"using QuickGraph.Glee\", it cannot find the assembly.  Did I make a mistake, or have the newer versions dropped Glee support?\nÂ \nThank you for your help!",
