    "Description": "Hi!\nI've noticed that actions\n```\nFormatEdge and FormatVertex from GraphvizAlgorithm\n```\nare of inconsistent type namings.\nAs is, \n```\nFormatEdge is of type FormatEventAction<...>\n```\nand \n```\nFormatVertex is of type FormatVertexEventHandler<..>\n```\nI suppose it wasn't done intentionally, and it wouldn't be fixed due to backwards compatibility.\nHowever, I think it would be useful for you to be aware of such issue, if you are not :)\n\nThanks!",
