    "Description": "Hello! I use BreadthFirstSearchAlgorithm in QuickGraph 3.0. Traverse on my graph (see attached picture) is incorrect.\nI use events TreeEdge and NonTreeEdge. I have edges in order 1-2-5-3-6-4 instead 1-2-5-3-4-6.\nÂ \nThank you.",

    {
      "Message": "I believe 1-2-5-3-6-4 is correct. Vertices B and D are at the same depth from root thus you receive their ancestors in succession and the correct order is 3-6. Then the last vertex is E, which is connected by edge 4.",

      "Message": "The order happens as expected. BFS is implemented with a FIFO queue so this ordering matches the traditional definition of this algorithm. Edge 6 is pushed on the queue when state D is visited (after edge 5). This happens before edge 4 is pushed in the queue. Thus, 4 is the last edge.",
