    "Description": "First of all, this isn't a bug report, its more like a feature proposal and a big thank you.\nQuickgraph was really helpful in so many places and now its time to give something back.\n \nThe graphviz output currently has a few bugs and limitations.\nWithin the last project i needed to fix most of them and to produce a somewhat more flexible output.\nYou'll find the result of these efforts attached to the issue.\n \nSo these changes include:\n  - Removed no longer existing graph, edge and node attributes.\n  - Fixed attribute spelling errors.\n  - Fixed edge head/tail-port output.\n  - Added some missing graph,edge and node attributes.  \n  - Unified serialization.\n  - Added support for clusters. (needs the fix from Issue: #22746 )\n  - Added support for composite vertex/edge styles (e.g. Filled | Dashed | Bold )\n  - Added support for color lists/gradients.\n  - Added support for arrow combinations.\n  - Added GraphvizColors for System.Drawing.Colors.",
