    "Description": "I have just started using QuickGraph in Silverlight. It will be light (but important) use. Thanks.\n \nI want to include a reference to the Silverlight-version dll in a combined Silverlight/WPF project. My application is desktop/web/online/offline. I have created some base User Controls in Silverlight that can be shared between both modules. I was able to use the Silverlight 2 System.Windows in the WFP base module, not QuickGraph.\n \nWhen I try to compile my common classes in VS 2008 which include references to QuickGraph, I receive the following:\n \nError 7 Assembly generation failed -- Referenced assembly 'QuickGraph.Silverlight' does not have a strong name\n \nWould it be possible to generate a strong-named version in the next build?\n \nI am trying to avoid the possible workaround of dissembly followed by reassembly with my own strong key :)",
