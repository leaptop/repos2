    "Description": "Having a static graph object within a ASP.NET environment it seems that the graph cannot be used a second time.\nA graph should be usable as input for an algorithm such as dijkstrashortest on other requests. It seems that a static graph after the first request is not valid for usage within an algorithm. ASP.NET doesn't find any result? (Key not found errors).\nWhat happens to a graph when asp.net closes the response? Is there a way to keep the graph valid within an asp.net environment?",
