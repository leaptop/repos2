    "Description": "I have a Dijkstra graph which I want to stop running when a particular node is reached (under certain circumstances). To do this, I added a FinishVertex listener to the algorithm, in which I want to abort the graph computation.\n \nMy first attempt was to call the Abort method on the Dijkstra algorithm. I found that this doesn't do anything because the Dijkstra algorithm uses a BredthFirstSearchAlgorithm internally, so the call wasn't going to the right code. I guess the intention is for this to be invisible, so I think the request should be passed through to the internal object.\n \nMy second attempt was to use the sender object passed in to the event handler:\n \nAlgorithmBase<IVertexListGraph<int, MarkedEdge<int, MoveGraphRunnerData.MoveRouteLinkRow>>> searcher =\n    sender as AlgorithmBase<IVertexListGraph<int, MarkedEdge<int, MoveGraphRunnerData.MoveRouteLinkRow>>>;\nsender.Abort();\n \nThis doesn't work because when the Dijkstra runs the BredthFirstSearchAlgorithm, it doesn't set the state of the algorithm to Running. I worked around this with a bit of reflection:\n \ntypeof(AlgorithmBase<IVertexListGraph<int, MarkedEdge<int, MoveGraphRunnerData.MoveRouteLinkRow>>>)\n            .GetField(\"state\", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance).SetValue(searcher, ComputationState.Running);\n \nAnd now it works.",
