    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI'm trying to do this..\n \n \nstatic void graphviz_FormatEdge(object sender, FormatEdgeEventArgs> \n{\n    e.EdgeFormatter.FontColor = Color.RoyalBlue;\n    e.EdgeFormatter.Length = 2;\n}\n \n \nHowever, I see that \"Length\" isn't present. I had to add..\n \nprivate int length = 1;\n \nif (this.length != 1){    dic[\"len\"] = this.length;}\n \nand\n \npublic int Length{    get    {        return this.length;    }    set    {        this.length = value;     }}\n \nor, am I missing an alternative?",

I'll try out a few more .. e.g. the \"image\" attr for a vertex, the ability to source and embed an image.
