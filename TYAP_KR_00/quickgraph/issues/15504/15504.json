    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI am new in Quick Graph and trying to Serialize and Deserialize but I'm currently having problems with it.\nHere is the overall scenario. I am generating a route from shape file data using dijkstra algorithm and undirected graph object. This is working but it is providing me severe performance problems. I planned to prepare and serialize a set of undirected graph object and edge factory object so that I can deserialize the same for routing and hopefully resolve the performance issue.\n \nFirst, I tried to use .NET serialization and deserialization for these two objects. When I tried this approach, the serialization and deserialization seems to happen but upon using the deserialized undirected graph object and edgeCost object, I get \"The given key was not present in the dictionary\" error.\n \nSecond, I tried to do serialization and deserialization using GraphML options in QuickGraph but received the following error below.\n \nThe type 'QuickGraph.UndirectedGraph<int,QuickGraph.Edge<int>>' cannot be used as type parameter 'TGraph' in the generic type or method 'QuickGraph.Serialization.GraphMLExtensions.DeserializeFromGraphML<TVertex,TEdge,TGraph>(TGraph, System.Xml.XmlReader, QuickGraph.IdentifiableVertexFactory<TVertex>, QuickGraph.IdentifiableEdgeFactory<TVertex,TEdge>)'. There is no implicit reference conversion from 'QuickGraph.UndirectedGraph<int,QuickGraph.Edge<int>>' to 'QuickGraph.IMutableVertexAndEdgeListGraph<int,QuickGraph.Edge<int>>'.\n \n \nI have created a small sample to shows these issues. Any input in this regard will be very helpful. If you feel I should take a completely different approach for the performance problem, please let me know.\n \nSample Code is attached with this Issue\n \nRegards,\n \nSudip",
