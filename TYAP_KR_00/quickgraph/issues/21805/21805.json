    "Description": "Hi all!\n \nThis may be a problem:\n \n \n \n \n            var g = new UndirectedGraph<int, UndirectedEdge<int>>();\n \n            g.AddVerticesAndEdge(new UndirectedEdge<int>(1, 2));\n \n            var c = g.ContainsEdge(2, 1); // false\n \n \nThe last line returns false, however since this is an undirected graph, IMHO should really return true. Am I wrong?",
