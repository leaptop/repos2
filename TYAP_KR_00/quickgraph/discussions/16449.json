    "Html": "Hi Jonathan,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was happy to find this package because it supports one of my main requirements: serialization to GraphML and back. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get even your serialization round-trip example to work. I made a copy of the QuickGraph.Tests folder and added it as a project to my solution. I ripped out all files from the QuickGraph.Tests project that did not compile because of references to System.Threading which I don't seem to have in my .NET installation. After this I was able to build the executable. When run it generated a html file which had 476 tests but one failure: the serialization test !! I also created the following snippet:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>      static void Main(string[] args)<br>\r\n      {<br>\r\n         GraphMLSerializerTest serializerTest = new GraphMLSerializerTest();</p>\r\n<p>         serializerTest.RoundTrip();<br>\r\n      }<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut this fails with the same error: an AccessViolation exception at GraphMLSerializer.cs line 516.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am using VS2008 installed on an x64 Vista machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas anybody else had this same problem ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks</p>\r\n",
