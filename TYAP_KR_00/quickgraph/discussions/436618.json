    "Html": "I am looking for an algorithm to find all paths from one given vertex to another given vertex in a directed non-acyclic graph. The paths must include cycles as well, but only once. For example, if you have a graph like this:\r<br />\n<br />\nA-&gt;B\r<br />\nB-&gt;C\r<br />\nB-&gt;D\r<br />\nC-&gt;A\r<br />\n<br />\nand your start node is A and end node is D, I want my paths to be:\r<br />\n<br />\nA, B, D\r<br />\nA, B, C, A, B, D\r<br />\n<br />\nbut not\r<br />\n<br />\nA, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C, D\r<br />\n<br />\nNaturally, the C node could be a whole other subgraph.\r<br />\nI have an algorithm based on depth-first search but it stops as soon as it visits a vertex twice so it does not find the path that includes a cycle.\r<br />\n<br />\nI realize this is more of a graph theory question than a QuickGraph one but I hope someone can help.<br />\n",
