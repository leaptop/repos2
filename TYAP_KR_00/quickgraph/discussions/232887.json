The main reason is for network backup. In case one path has a failure some where, We want to route the\r\n data to a all separated path, all nodes must be different, Beside the start and the end. After a lot of reading I understand that Suurball's algorithm is doing it. Is there any implementation for that problem? If not can you please add it? I am kind of lost\r\n with that problem, too complicated for me to understand. I would appreciate any kind of help. Thanks again.",
