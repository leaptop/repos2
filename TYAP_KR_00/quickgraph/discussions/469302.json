I managed to do this in C code with GraphViz by using Agraph_t <em>agsubg(Agraph_t</em>, char*, int) function, setting rank attribute and making invisible edges but I need to make this in C#. So my question is how to make subgraphs/clusters using QuickGraph. Or maybe there is a way to make this work without subgraphs.<br />\n",
