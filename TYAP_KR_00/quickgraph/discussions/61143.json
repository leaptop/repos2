I have created some base User Controls in Silverlight that can be shared between both modules. I was able to use the Silverlight 2 System.Windows in the WFP base module, not QuickGraph.</p>\r\n<p>When I try to compile my common classes in VS 2008 which include references to QuickGraph, I receive the following:</p>\r\n<p>Error&nbsp;7&nbsp;Assembly generation failed -- Referenced assembly 'QuickGraph.Silverlight' does not have a strong name</p>\r\n<p>Would it be possible to generate a strong-named version in the next build?</p>\r\n<p>I am trying to avoid the possible workaround of dissembly followed by reassembly with my own strong key :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
