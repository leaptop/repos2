Meaning that while I add nodes and edges, the graph will throw me an exception if a cyclic path exists instead of adding the node and then checking .IsDirectedAcyclicGraph? (I've used AdjacencyGraph so far)\r<br />\n<br />\n2) Is it possible to use a function as an 'aggregator'? I would like to get a topological sort for a particular vertex, then being able to execute some code at each of the dependant nodes and aggregate the result. (Like for example having a directed graph of ints, and passing a sum function to sum all the dependant nodes of any particular node)\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers\r<br />\nLeo<br />\n",
