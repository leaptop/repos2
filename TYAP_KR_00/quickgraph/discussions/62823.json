These two methods belong together as part of the standard Contains/TryGet pattern, and in fact the interface for directed graphs (IIncidenceGraph) that defines the ContainsEdge(source,target) method does also define a TryGetEdge(source,target,out edge) method. I think this was just overlooked.</p>",
