I guess that you've made changes and replaced them with something else.<br />Can you please provide a more up to date example of using GLEE? I would appreciate that! I'm using QuickGraph and GLEE for my Thesis.<br /><br />PS. May I suggest something? Update and enrich User Manual. Provide more samples.<br />",
