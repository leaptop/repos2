I'm using quickgraph ver. 3.1.40122.0 for .net framework 3.5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advanced and regards.<br>\r\n",

I don't know if this is an error or not because I'm a begginer with this API.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI solved it with a &quot;little trick&quot;. Keep the data structure of <strong>UndirectedGraph </strong>for compatibility purposes, and change edge direction to <strong>None</strong> on rendering tier, and get a true correspondence between data structure and rendering tier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards.<br>\r\n",
