I have a slight problem with the definition of&nbsp;GraphvizAlgorithm class' FormatEdge event. In the document and source code (Change Set&nbsp;36262), the event is defined using delegate&nbsp;FormatEdgeEventHandler&lt;TVertex,TEdge&gt;, however I couldn't use this in my project, I have to use&nbsp;FormatEdgeAction instead of&nbsp;FormatEdgeEventHandler to make it work. This worries me a bit since I'm not sure if I'm using the correct dll and source code, the dll version is strange as well, it's&nbsp;3.2.40610.0, even though the download page says it's&nbsp;3.3.40824.00, any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
