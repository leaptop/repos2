Today I downloaded latest version of it, but unfortunately i saw that some of the classes had been removed (such that IdentifiableEdge, IdentifiableVertex) which i used them in many places in my&nbsp; source.&nbsp; I looked and tried to find new classes that took place of these missing classes but i couldn't succeed.&nbsp; Are there any classes in this latest version similar to IdentifiableEdge, IdentifiableVertex classes that i couldn't detect?</p>",
