Here is&nbsp;my question, is&nbsp;there a way to stop the algorithm after that&nbsp;I&nbsp;reach the wanted vertex in DijkstraShortestPathAlgorithm. In my particular case i use relativelly big graph (42k edge, 15k vertex) and i may have to call it really often. So i&nbsp; should probably gain time if i could stop it after i reach my target. In my modified version of DijkstraShortestPathAlgorithm i got the target vertex information.</p>\r\n<p>Also i have profile the dijkstra for the same type of graph and ive see that 80% of the compute time is on this line</p>\r\n<p>&gt;&gt;var vertices = this.vertexQueue.ToArray(); from AssertHeap() in DijkstraShortestPathAlgorithm takes 5670 ms and was called 16931&nbsp;times</p>\r\n<p>since this is just used to do some assert, is there a different way that i could pre validate data to avoid to do it there, or if i delete this validation i may cause trouble to computed graph?</p>\r\n<p>thz in advance</p>",
