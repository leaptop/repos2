These delegates are passed DirectedGraphNode and DirectedGraphLink objects to capture these tweaks.&nbsp; Unfortunately\r\n there appears to be no way to add additional attributes to the nodes and links.&nbsp; As I understand DGML, the set of attributes is quite open ended.&nbsp; The spec defines a set but users are free to add more.&nbsp; Is there a way of doing this using the\r\n standard QuickGraph support?&nbsp; In particular, I'd like add a Description attribute to the *links*.&nbsp; This is supported on nodes but not links.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff</p>\r\n",
