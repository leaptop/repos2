We observed that dll with this version is not installed when some versions (probably older, I am still not very sure\r\n about this) of .NET 4 are installed. This is causing problem to me. &nbsp;However the problem was solved when the .Net 4.0 framework is upgraded. But still on some of my machine where .Net 4.0 is installed (Without upgrading .Net 4.0), It throws the exception\r\n :</p>\r\n<p><strong>Could not load file or assembly 'System.Core, Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e, Retargetable=Yes' or one of its&nbsp;dependencies. The given assembly name or codebase was invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131047)</strong></p>\r\n<p>However, &nbsp;I just used NuGet QuickGraph 3.6.61119.7 source code to replace the old assemblies of 2.0.5.0 with the new one 4.0 and created my own nuget packages which solves the problem. But I still like to directly install upgraded NuGet QuickGraph pacakge\r\n which solve my problem. Can you provide me the upgraded NuGet QuickGraph&nbsp;3.6.61119.7 &nbsp;?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Sanz Bajracharya</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
