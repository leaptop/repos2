I though QuickGraph used this?</p>\r\n<p>I didn't just make this up, but read it at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/574\">http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/574</a>&nbsp;which says:&nbsp;&quot;<a title=\"QuickGraph, 100% C# directed graph library\" href=\"http://mbunit.tigris.org\"><strong><span style=\"color:#cc9966\">QuickGraph</span></strong></a> implements 2 maximum flow algorithms: Edmund Karp and Push Relabel. We will use PushRelabel as it is more efficient, however, both inherit from the abstract base class MaximumFlowAlgorithm.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Am I missing something? Any help gratefully received...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
