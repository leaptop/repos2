It takes me around 20 mins to add all those edges into the graph. Below is my code. My question is, am I do anything wrong? Are there any way to speed up my process. My graph actually is a immutable graph. But I simply use mutable graph here because it has a few working example. <br />\n<pre><code>        userGraph = new AdjacencyGraph&lt;int, SEdge&lt;int&gt;&gt;();\n        userGraph.AddVertexRange(index.usermap.addr2uid.Values); // addr2uid is a dictionary contains all vertices\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; index.weights.weights.Count; i++) //index.weight.weights is another dictionary contains all Edge&lt;-&gt;weight mappings.\n        {\n            int source = index.weights.weights.ElementAt(i).Key.source;\n            int target = index.weights.weights.ElementAt(i).Key.target;\n            SEdge&lt;int&gt; v_edge = new SEdge&lt;int&gt;(source,target);\n            userGraph.AddEdge(v_edge);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\nAny suggestion is highly appreciated!<br />\n",
