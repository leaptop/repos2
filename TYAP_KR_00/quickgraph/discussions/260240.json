I can have many many flights, and one user could go from airport B at 5pm and take a flight (1) at 6\r\n pm to airport C, an other one could go from airport B at 7pm and take a flight (2) at 9 pm to airport D<br>\r\nMeaning that there will be one node with flight (1) and (2), and the other one only with (2).</p>\r\n<p>Any clue how to build such a tree?</p>\r\n<p>The fact is that all same flight arrow are pointing to the same node. That's the only property i found about my graph.</p>\r\n<p>That's for a school work</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The goal of this is to find out the minimum price from airport A to airport Z, knowing a lot lot lot of flights, by applying Djikstra</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nThanks a lot !</p>\r\n",
