Vertexes are tables, edges are foreign key constraints.<br /><br />I'm really illiterate on graph theory, hence why I'm asking if there is a way to find the critical path using the existing framework or if I have to modify one of the algorithms (DijkstraShortestPathAlgorithm perhaps) to do this. A DAG exactly represents my problem hence why I chose it.<br /><br />As for the exact path, won't the DFS algorithm give me the shortest path to a node? Assuming, that I have multiple paths to a node, I need the critical path, not the shortest path.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />-Nick<br />",
