When I bypassed that relationship it ran to completion.  This is a valid conditions for a Table Relationship...do I need to change something?  <br /><br />Also,  I'm not sure the TopologicalSort helps me here?  What I want to find out is.....say A user selects fields from two tables to query but those tables do not have a relationship.  What is the best way to discover the additional tables needed for the join?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Rich<br />",
